# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 8th, 2021 - TlustyZmrdi.net

**Today's Progress**: Added a service for loading data of sound quotes

**Thoughts:** I had some issues with Blazor WASM. Also I should really work on CI/CD pipeline, so there's always latest version of app deployed. Maybe I should not include the data (audio files etc) in source control, in case of some.. copyright issues :>

**Link to work:** No link :)

### Day 2: February 9th, 2021 - TlustyZmrdi.net

**Today's Progress**: Worked on CI/CD pipeline - but I haven't finished it, yet. Image gets built from source, then pushed to dockerhub, then GitHub action connects via SSH to server and.. so far, just does "ls" :-)

**Thoughts:** GitHub is kinda nice!

**Link to work:** No link :|
