# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 8th, 2021 - TlustyZmrdi.net

**Today's Progress**: Added a service for loading data of sound quotes

**Thoughts:** I had some issues with Blazor WASM. Also I should really work on CI/CD pipeline, so there's always latest version of app deployed. Maybe I should not include the data (audio files etc) in source control, in case of some.. copyright issues :>

**Link to work:** No link :)

### Day 2: February 9th, 2021 - TlustyZmrdi.net

**Today's Progress**: Worked on CI/CD pipeline - but I haven't finished it, yet. Image gets built from source, then pushed to dockerhub, then GitHub action connects via SSH to server and.. so far, just does "ls" :-)

**Thoughts:** GitHub is kinda nice!

**Link to work:** No link :|

### Day 3: February 10th, 2021 - TlustyZmrdi.net

**Today's Progress**: Worked on CI/CD pipeline - finished it! Every change to master branch now builds and deploys new version of FatFucks to production! Also, after struggle with creating new ca-sln project, made it work! so tomorrow - cleanup of this project (mainly removing the angular part)

**Thoughts:** WSL rocks!

**Link to work:** No link :|

### Day 4: February 11th, 2021 - TlustyZmrdi.net

**Today's Progress**: Refactored project to use clean architecture on backend. Added one sound from 13th Warrior.

**Thoughts:** Super tired! But still did it! 

**Link to work:** This project is not public, so :( probably not the best project for this challenge?

### Day 5: February 12th, 2021 - TlustyZmrdi.net

**Today's Progress**: Bad day :/ I added IdentityServer yesterday and I really had.. I'm having a really hard time getting certificate to work in docker.. so I worked on that, with no success

**Thoughts:** Frustrated? No! But tired.. will work more than a hour tomorrow.

**Link to work:** This project is not public, so :( probably not the best project for this challenge?
